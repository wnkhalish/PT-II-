// ? This program shows how to determine whether two circles overlap using the procedural programming

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// distance: To calculate the distance between two circles using the pythagorasâ€™ theorem
//           (x1, y1) and (x2,y2) are the center point of the two circles, respectively.

{
	double dx = x2 - x1;
	double dy = y2 - y1;

	return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

// overlap: To determine whether two circles overlap by using their distance
//           (x1, y1, r1) and (x2,y2, r2) are the coordinates x and y of the center, the radius, r of the two circles, respectively.

bool overlap(double x1, double y1, double r1, double x2, double y2, double r2)
